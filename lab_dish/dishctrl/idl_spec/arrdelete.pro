; NAME:
;   ARRDELETE

;
; PURPOSE:
;   Remove a portion of an existing array.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;   NEWARR = ARRDELETE(INIT, [AT=POSITION,] [LENGTH=NELEM])
;
; DESCRIPTION: 
;
;   ARRDELETE will remove or excise a portion of an existing array,
;   INIT, and return it as NEWARR.  The returned array will never be
;   larger than the initial array.
;
;   By using the keywords AT and LENGTH, which describe the position
;   and number of elements to be excised respectively, any segment of
;   interest can be removed.  By default the first element is removed.
;
; INPUTS:
;
;   INIT - the initial array, which will have a portion deleted.  Any
;          data type, including structures, is allowed.  Regardless of
;          the dimensions of INIT, it is treated as a one-dimensional
;          array.  If OVERWRITE is not set, then INIT itself is
;          unmodified.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;
;   AT - a long integer indicating the position of the sub-array to be
;        deleted.  If AT is non-negative, then the deleted portion
;        will be NEWARR[AT:AT+LENGTH-1].  If AT is negative, then it
;        represents an index counting from then *end* of INIT,
;        starting at -1L.
;        Default: 0L (deletion begins with first element).
;
;  LENGTH - a long integer indicating the number of elements to be
;           removed.  
;
;  OVERWRITE - if set, then INIT will be overwritten in the process of
;              generating the new array.  Upon return, INIT will be
;              undefined.
;
;  COUNT - upon return, the number of elements in the resulting array.
;          If all of INIT would have been deleted, then -1L is
;          returned and COUNT is set to zero.
;
;  EMPTY1 - if set, then INIT is assumed to be empty (i.e., to have
;           zero elements).  The actual value passed as INIT is
;           ignored.
;
; RETURNS:
;
;   The new array, which is always one-dimensional.  If COUNT is zero,
;   then the scalar -1L is returned.

;   STORE_ARRAY in IDL Astronomy Library
