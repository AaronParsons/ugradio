11 APR:
	show and tell: look at results of OH, pulsar expts.  results:
zilch.  nobody got OH spectra, pulsar stuff looked awful.  sampling
issues and time constant issues.  we will redo ourselves. 

	544: discussed HI experiments, observing technique, using
multiple offs for an on. groups decided what to do.



18 APR:
	show and tell. i hear everybody got some data. so look into
intensity calibration, chdoppler application, makaing spectra join when
making an image. are they using structures?
	how to do imaging
	docs to distribute: bididl, annotating images, makeps

	discuss galactic astronomy. derive the doppler vel vs gal rot.
briefly discuss brightness temp. how to derive HI mass.



25 APR:
	show and tell.
	fount handout; intensive discussion in 544.

2 MAY:
	extensive show and tell

	544: look at websites of arecibo, gbt, vla; sidelobe responses,
spillover, feedlegs
