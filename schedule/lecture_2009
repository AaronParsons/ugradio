Start with eqn 9 in lab handout.

Define alpha in eqn 15a.

rewrite eqn 9 in terms of alpha. 

This is first half of eqn 18.

Second half of eqn 18 ic

MF - \int I(\Delta h) cos(2 \pi f_f \delta h) d (Delta h)

Explain whaat this means pictorially.

Note, particularly , the importance of zero points.

-----------------

for a circular source...eqn 20.

rewrite eqn 20 in terms of \Delta h/R

then go to eqn 22.

so:

from your DATA:

1. find the ha(s) where you have zero crossing(s)

2. calculate the local fringe freq at those ha's


do some THEORY:

1. Program eqn 22 and make a graph of MF_theory versus f_f R

2. MAke a list of those values of f_f R where MF_theory = 0

combine THY with DATA

3. Match these theoretical MF_theory zeros with the observed ones. This
   gives values of f_f R. You know the f_f for these from equation 11, so
   you can geb one value of R for each zero crossing.
