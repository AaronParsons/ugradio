lab reports due today, so there is no show/tell.

so we will do show/tell with the interferometer

---------------------- CARL INTRO:
block diagram. heterodyne principle. how to determine the observing
frequency. what are the observing freq band? 
how to ensure that the lo freqs are what they are supposed
to be.

sanity check on interf: observe the sun. or the moon. The moon is up this
year. 

----------------------- GEOFF: HOW TO USE THE INTERFEROMETER
	programs that control the telescopes
	encoder basics: absolute verus incremental. homing.
	programs that display and record the data.
	how to set up an observing script

------------------------ CARL: ANGULAR COORD SYSTEMS
*********** go outside: it's a nice night.

hour angle, declination
longitude, latitude

we will do the conversion. run thru physical pointing.

how stars move in the sky : lst, ra, ha

********* go inside

TIME SYSTEMS: ASTRONOMICAL...
right ascension
hour angle
LST -------------------> ha= lst - ra

TIME SYSTEMS: CIVIL...
PST
UT

R_earth=6378, so we have 2.2 millisec/meterm 2,2 sec/km, 3.5 sec/mile

Julian day. Current is 2454509.0 = 6724 yr. ALWAYS UT. begins at
noon Greenwich (and at midnight on the int'l date line). IDL routines: 
	CALDAT gives calendar date from julian day
	JULDAY gives julian day from calendar data
	current julday: print, systime(/julian, /ut)
	mjd =  jd - 2400000.5

CONVERTING BETWEEN CIVIL AND ASTRONOMICAL TIME

***what is the diff in RATE?
earth goes around sun 365 times per year
BETTER: sun goes around earth 365 times per year
how many time per year does a star go around the earth?

DANCE ROUTINE
     diff: sun moves because of earth spin
     star moves because of earath spin AND solar orbit.
     THIS is the SIDEREAL day.
     so a star goes around 366 times when sun goes around
365.

     THUS: a sidereal second is SHORTER than a solar second
   DELTA SIDEREAL TIE = (365.25/366.25)* DELTA SOLAR TIME

        a star rises earlier tomorrow than it does today.
            how much earlier? 1/365 of a day. 4 min.
            or: distance sun oves in one day: 1 degree!
            annoying when you are at the telescope!

***how is the ZERO POINT defined? LST is zero when sun crosses equator
   going north.

***Calculating LST from CT:  ROUTINES WE PROVIDE: (based on gsfc ct2lst)

lst -- prints lst right now

lstnow: a function.
ilst: gives lst for a specified julian date: print, ilst(julian=juldate)
lstnow: gives curr lst = lstnow()
systime(/julian, /utc) gives current julian day (which contains the
                        current ime, too--it's not just an integer
                        number. the /utc is required for it to give
			julian date relative to greenwich, which is the
			only one that means anything.
systime() gives current local ltime as a strin
systime(/sec) gives seconds elapsed since 1 January 1970
