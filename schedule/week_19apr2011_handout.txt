---BASIC COLOR PHYSIOLOGY
-Eye has three cones: red, green, blue.
-Eye sensitiviy: green, red, blue a distant third
-These colors are orhthogonal (but not orthnormal!)
-Combinations of these colors give all colors perceptible.
-Colors for standard device drivers are reprsented by BYTE
	variables. Thus color intensities go from 0 to 255.
-Note: an emitting color can be monochromatic, so TV phosphors can have
       any combo of wavelengths as long as they don't overlap with cones
       of other colors.

-Basic color arithmetic:
        r + g + b = white = w
        r + g = w - b = magenta = m
        r + b = w - g = yellow = y
        g + b = w - r = cyan = c
        r = w - (g + b) = w - cyan
        g = w - (r + b) = w - magenta
        b = w - (r + g) = w - yellow

---SPECIFYING RGB COLORS

Most computers these days use truecolor.  In truecolor, each color has
256 possible intensities. The color is specified by a three-byte
number, i.e. a number to the base 256::
red:	0+0	      to  0+255
green:	256+0	      to  256+255
blue:	256^2+0	      to  256^2+255

-We need to use long integers to express a color other than red:
fully bright red:   255l		or !red	
fully bright green: 256l * 255l		or !green 
fully bright blue:  256l^2l * 255l	or !blue 

-We need to use double-long integers when manipulating as below:
half-bright red: 127l			or !red * 127ll/255ll
half-bright green: 256l * 127l		or !green * 127ll/255ll
half-bright red: 256l^2l * 127l 	or !blue * 127ll/255ll

For a mixture of color with intensity (r, g, b), where each runs from 0
      to 255:
number = [256l^2 * b] + [256l * g] + [r]

---DYES AND PIGMENTS: CMYK COLORS

RGB colors are additive. Tottlly different are artists' paint and
printer ink, which produce color by ABSORBING WHITE LIGHT and reflecting
the unabsorbed remainder.  This leads to the CMYK system, used on
printers, which is also required for ApJ submissions.  See CMYK color
system in IDL help.  in IDL, you convert using CMYK_CONVERT (the
documentation is wrong--conversion formulae differ. see the proc.

converting from RGB to CMYK:

K = 255 - max( r,g,b)
C = 255 [1 - R/(255 - K)] (if K=255 then C=0)
M = 255 [1 - G/(255 - K)] (if K=255 then M=0)
Y = 255 [1 - B/(255 - K)] (if K=255 then Y=0)

converting from CMYK to RGB:

R = (255 - C) (1 - K/255)
G = (255 - M) (1 - K/255)
B = (255 - Y) (1 - K/255)
K gives the overall intensity and the colors are in C, M,
Y. High-quality color printing uses more colors than just CMY.

EXAMPLE 1: Consider pure white light: (R,G,B)=255. Then
	(C,M,Y,K)=0. This means that no ink is put on the paper.

EXAMPLE 2. Consider pure blackness. (R,G,B=0). (C,M,Y,K)=(0,0,0,255) [but
        CMYK_CONVERT erroneously returns (c,m,y,k)=255]. This means that
        no C, M, or Y ink is jetted; and full B is jetted.

EXAMPLE 3. Consider pure red at half full intensity. Then
	(R,G,B)=(127,0,0). Then (C,M,Y,K)=(0,255,255,128), i.e. half
	black, full M and Y. [Without the black (K=0), full M and Y
	gives R.]

---COLOR PLOTTING and COLORBLIND ISSUES

the background and line width matter A LOT. LOOK at your final product!

About 15% of males are red/green colorblind.  To learn about, and take a
      test, go to
      http://www.toledo-bend.com/colorblind
      this also has links to other sites including one which lets a
	   noncolorblind person see what a colorblind one would.

The BASIC RULES: 
    -BE COLORBLIND FRIENDLY! DON'T USE COLOR unless you have to!  
    -use MAGENTA and CYAN, NOT RED and GREEN.

----PRINTING AND POWERPOINTING

LASER PRINTERS are terrible for anything but primary colors Use Inkjets!
the poster printer is an inkjet. See examples.

IMPORTING INTO POWERPOINT AND OPENOFFICE: it really matters what hou
do.

PS is not accepted by PowerPoint: use 'convert' to change ps to eps.
      EPS is converted to pixel image by PowerPoint and the result can
      look unclear. Better: convert to a huge pixel image PNG file 

  convert -verbose -antialias -density 600 -geometry 25% -quality 95

      import, and downsize within PowerPoint. Play with
      contrast--excellent results. (But it doesn't seem to work well in
      early versions of openoffice. Mac?)
