		USING THE INTERFEROMETER


	You need to run two sessions of idl, one to move the telescopes
and one to to record and see the data. 

-----------------------RUNNING THE TELESCOPES---------------------

1. Make sure that your .idlenv file (in your home directory) specifies
   to start idl with:

        setenv   IDL_STARTUP    /home/ay121/.idlstartup

2. to track a source, you need to calculate its alt and az periodically
and move the telescopes accordingly. for the moon and sun, you can get
the alt and az by...

	imoon, altmoon, azmoon, /aa

	isun, altsun, azsun, /aa

for any other source, precess its coordinates to the current epoch; the
easy way is to use the GSFC precess procedure, for which the excellent
documented is accessible with doc_library in the usual way. note the
units of the angles (e.g. r.a. in degrees, not hours!). check the table
in the lab handout, which shows some precessed coordinates, to make sure
you are doing it correctly. then use hd2aa.pro, or your own angle
conversion routine, to obtain alt az from hour angle/dec. 

3.  to actually point the telescope, use the point2 function, for which
the excellent documented is accessible with doc_library in the usual
way.  if pointing to the sun, you would use... 

	result= point2(alt=altsun, az=azsun)


4. periodically you need to home the telescope because our inremental
encoders are sometimes malfunctioning. we recommend every hour or so,
maybe more frequently, do this with...

	homer

   data that is obtained during the homing process should be removed
   in post-processing.

5. finally, you need to put all this in a loop so that the telescopes
continually track the source, preferably from rise to set. our altitude
limit is about 10 degrees, so you can write a procedure to wait until
the source comes up and track it all day until it sets.

	an examaple of this is in...

	/home/heiles/ay121/idl/xband/point2/trackmoon.idlprc

6. when you are finished, please stow the telescope. a good way to do
this is with...

	 homer


ERRORS:

	if it gives an error when trying to point the dishes, restart
quasar and pulsar according to the instructions in a separate memo. 


----------------------RUNNING THE CHART-----------------------

	in the old days, the 'chart recorder' was a moving pen writing
across a long strip of moving paper on a roll. these days we simulate it
on a computer screen. use a separate session of idl that does nothing
else. this will also save your data in a save file whose name it prompts
for. 


1. see step 1 of RUNNING THE TELESCOPES above.

2. to run a single channel chart recorder, which reads the HP 3478A
multimeter (the dvm)...

	startchart1

3. to run the double channel chart recorder, which reads two channesl
from the ADC...

	@startchart_2.idl

4. to run both the single and double channel chart recorders...

	@startchart_1and2.idl

These procedures can be found in /home/ay121/idl/chart/

ERRORS:

	the dvm reader might quit.  under most circumstances it will
return an error message, send an email to cyndy and carl, and
start ringing the terminal bell incessantly.  to stop it, hit ctrl c. 
then fix pulsar according to the directions in a separate memo. 


----------------------USEFUL IDL ROUTINES---------------------

a= lstnow()		gives current lst in hours

lst			prints current lst on the screen

aa2hd, hd2aa		alt,az to ha,dec and vice versa

a=systime(1)		gives systime in sec, monotonically increasing
			from a zero point many years ago.

a=systime()		current local date, local time in human-readable format

a=systime(/utc)		as above but in UT

a=systime(\utc,\julian)	current julian date
