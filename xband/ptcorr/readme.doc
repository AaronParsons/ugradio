this subdir contains software for determining and analyzing telescope
pointing data. it contains some obsolete routines and should be cleaned
out.

FOR ALL XBAND INTERFEROMETER OBSERVATIONS, ENTER IDL WITH: 
	source /home/heiles/idlpoint
which invokes
	/home/heiles/dzd2/courses/ay121/idl/start_point.idl

---------

0. TO PERFORM REPETITIVE SCANS OVER THE SUN OR MOON:

	use the file 

	/home/heiles/ay121/idl/xband/ptcorr/scantest.idl

as the skeleton. this is an IDL command file, invoked with

	@scantest.idl


1. TO DERIVE GAUSSIAN COEFFICINTS FROM THE SCANS. First, get into the
subdir /home/heiles/ay121/idl/xband/ptcorr and run everything from there.

	edit the file 

	/home/heiles/ay121/idl/xband/ptcorr/fitscan_vermino.idl

putting in the list of save files and the subdirectory you want to
treat.  see the notes in fitscan_vermino.idl .  This is an IDL command
file, so invoke it with 

	@fitscan_vermino.idl

Having done this, 

	.run fitscan.idlprc

	This runs thru the specified scan save files and fits az and alt
scans for both dishes. it derives the gauss params and writes them into
a structure called FIT. It forces you to use the cursor to eliminate bad
points. finally, it writes them out into a file.

each input file has an output file. the form of the inputfilename is...
	Sat_Mar_15_12:13:28_2003_scan.sav
and the outputfilename is...
	Sat_Mar_15_12:13:28_2003_scanfit.sav


2. TO DERIVE POINTING COEFFICIENTS FROM THE GAUSSSFITS.

	edit the file 

	/home/heiles/ay121/idl/xband/ptcorr/fitcoeffs_vermino.idl

putting in the list of save files and the subdirectory you want to
treat.  This is how you discard data (by not including its file in the
list). This is an IDL command file, invoke it with 

	@fitcoeffs_vermino.idl

After doing this, the actual process of deriving the pointing
coefficients is done with...

	.run fitcoeffs.idlprc

	This runs thru the specified gaussfit save files and fits az and
alt pointing constants for both dishes.  it puts these constants into a
structure called COEFFS.  finally, it writes this structure (and the
original data) out into a save file. 

each set of input files has a single output file. 
the form of the inputfilenames is...
	Sat_Mar_15_12:13:28_2003_scanfit.sav
and the outputfilename is...
	Sat_Mar__15_12:13:28_2003_coeffs.sav

the time on the output file is equal to the one for the beginning scan
file. 

3.  DERIVING ACTUAL POINTING CONSTANTS, and inserting them into the
system for actual use... 

	Determining which constants to actually use is somewhat of an
art form.  should do separately for sun, moon, and reverse.  see how
everything compares.  See if there is any significant variation of
pointing constants with az and za.  if the reverse numbers are
consistent with the forward ones, the fits can be combined. 

	In spring 2003 we found that the only significant terms are the
'dial constants', meaning that the variation of pointing corrections
with az and za are not worth including. 

	The values of the pointing corrections need to be inserted into
the file 

	/home/ay120b/idl/point.config2

look at the documentation for that file, which is at the beginning,
carefully--you don't want to screw up formatwise.

	The corrections are implemented by 

/home/heiles/ay121/idl/xband/point2/correct.pro
