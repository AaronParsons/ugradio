couldn't make the SRS synthesizers work on computer control. when they
are both hooked up, it doen't work; when one of them is hooked up, it
doeswn't work; when the other is hooked up, it works for some
combinations of input numbers, but not all. conclude: a hardware
problem. 

it worked fine last year and the only diff isthat we moved the units to
the other rack. perhaps some HPIB cables or connectors were damaged. it
might be worth testing the cables/connectors

the control for the picosampler, the dishes, the HP synthesizer, and hp
DVM work fine. in particular, the SRS software (srs1_frq.pro) uses a
cumbersome write-on-disk method; while the synthesizer (set_hp.pro) uses
a cleaner code. i created a test version to runthe SRS (srs1_tst.pro)
using the same approach ads the synthesizer; behavior for both codes is
the same.

the software for the following work:
hp_dvm.pro
set_hp.pro
picosampler.pro
getpico.pro

the following doesn't work
dvm.pro
srs1*.pro
